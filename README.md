# Package Held

This package is being held by [Coopervision](https://coopervision.com/) as they reflect the packages we use internally. While we use a private NPM repository to host our real packages, we're aware that there is [a potential security vulnerability in having the package names publically available](https://medium.com/@alex.birsan/dependency-confusion-4a5d60fec610).

As such, we've opted to hold these packages for future usage to increase our security and ensure that we have flexability with these package names for potential future public usage.
